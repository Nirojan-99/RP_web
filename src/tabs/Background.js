        The rapid growth and influence of social media platforms have
        transformed the way people communicate, share information, and interact
        with brands. These platforms offer vast opportunities for advertisers to
        reach their target audience and deliver personalized marketing messages.
        However, the effectiveness of advertisements heavily relies on
        understanding user preferences, sentiments, and linguistic nuances,
        especially in diverse language contexts. In the context of the Tamil
        language, spoken by millions of people worldwide, especially in South
        India and Sri Lanka, catering to the specific needs and cultural
        sensitivities of Tamil-speaking users becomes paramount. Advertisers
        need to comprehend the intricacies of the language, including its unique
        vocabulary, expressions, and sentiments, to deliver impactful and
        culturally relevant advertisements. Moreover, the Tamil language
        presents a unique linguistic context for advertising. Understanding the
        nuances and cultural references within Tamil content is vital for
        creating effective advertising campaigns that resonate with
        Tamil-speaking users. Therefore, the development of an advertisement
        personalization system specifically for the Tamil language is
        significantly important. Several existing systems and approaches in the
        field of personalized advertising, provide insights and inspiration for
        the development of the proposed system. These systems employ natural
        language processing techniques and data analysis to deliver tailored
        advertisements. While the focus has predominantly been on English or
        other widely spoken languages, they serve as a foundation for extending
        personalized advertising to the Tamil language. One common approach in
        personalized advertising is keyword extraction. Systems analyze textual
        content to identify relevant keywords that capture users' interests. By
        identifying these keywords within social media posts and user-generated
        content, advertisers can target their advertisements more effectively.
        However, most existing systems primarily focus on English or other
        widely spoken languages, and limited research has been conducted for the
        Tamil language. Sentiment analysis is another significant component of
        personalized advertising system. By analyzing user comments and posts,
        these systems determine the sentiment expressed, allowing advertisers to
        align their advertisements with users' emotions and attitudes. Although
        sentiment analysis techniques have been extensively explored for
        English, fewer resources and tools exist specifically for the sentiment
        analysis of Tamil content. Next word prediction is a valuable feature
        that enhances the user experience and engagement on social media
        platforms. By suggesting the most likely next word or phrase as users
        type their comments or posts, these systems accelerate communication and
        streamline interactions. However, next word prediction models are often
        built for popular languages and may not be readily available for the
        Tamil language. Furthermore, image tracking and Tamil word extraction
        from images represent a promising area for personalized advertising
        systems. However, limited research has been conducted specifically on
        extracting Tamil words from images. The development of an advertisement
        personalization system for the Tamil language on social media platforms
        using natural language processing aims to bridge these gaps and extend
        personalized advertising to Tamil-speaking users. By leveraging the
        lessons learned from existing systems and tailoring them to the Tamil
        language, this system has the potential to revolutionize advertising
        strategies and provide advertisers with the tools to engage with
        Tamil-speaking users effectively.
