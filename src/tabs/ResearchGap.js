        The research problem addressed in this study is the lack of an effective
        and comprehensive advertisement personalization system specifically
        designed for the Tamil language on social media platforms. While
        advertisement personalization systems exist for various languages, there
        is a significant gap in the availability of such systems that cater to
        the unique linguistic characteristics and user preferences of
        Tamil-speaking individuals. The research problem encompasses the need
        for a system that can accurately extract relevant keywords from Tamil
        social media posts, perform sentiment analysis on Tamil comments,
        provide next word prediction for Tamil text, and track and extract Tamil
        words from images. Existing advertisement personalization systems often
        focus on major languages, neglecting the nuances and preferences of
        Tamil-speaking users. While some general-purpose systems may provide
        basic functionality, they do not address the specific challenges
        associated with the Tamil language and its user base on social media
        platforms. Consequently, there is a significant research gap that needs
        to be filled to develop a comprehensive and tailored system for
        advertisement personalization in the Tamil language. The research gap
        can be further highlighted by the limited availability of Tamil-specific
        natural language processing tools and resources. Existing systems may
        not adequately capture the linguistic intricacies of Tamil, resulting in
        suboptimal keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and next word
        prediction. Moreover, the ability to track and extract Tamil words from
        images is largely unexplored in existing systems, leaving a gap in
        effective visual content analysis and advertisement personalization for
        Tamil-speaking users. This research aims to bridge the existing gap by
        developing a robust advertisement personalization system specifically
        designed for the Tamil language on social media platforms. The system
        will leverage natural language processing techniques, utilize
        Tamil-specific tools and resources, and incorporate image tracking and
        word extraction capabilities, ultimately delivering targeted and
        culturally appropriate advertisements to Tamil-speaking users on social
        media platforms.
